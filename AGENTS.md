Before you provide a pull request always create the tests and execute them:
* Functional: Unit Tests
A pull request may only be created when all new functionality is covered by the tests and those tests execute successfully.

Never include binary files in the resulting pull request. Find ways to achieve the goal without binary files.

When you come along warnings, fix them right away.
